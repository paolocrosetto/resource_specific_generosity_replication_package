# Replication Package for "Resource-Specific Generosity"

This repository contains all data and scripts to replicate the results of the paper *Resource-Specific Generosity*.

## Dependencies

The analysis for the main plot and table of the paper requires `R` and some extra packages, in particular `tidyverse` and some plot theming (`hrbrthemes`) and compositing (`patchwork`) packages.

## Running the replication package

Run `Analysis.R`. It should take less than 3 minutes. The script produces all Figures and Plots, that are saved in the relevant subfolder.
