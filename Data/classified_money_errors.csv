R_74NPbcqogVfHPeE,I split the amount evenly because I think it is only fair that we get the same amount. I would want someone to share the $10 with me so it is only fair that I also split the money.,SOCIALNORM
R_6Qn93cSFob3sMxe,I split the money evenly because this was the most fair way of doing things. I would feel guilty if I more money than my partner.,SOCIALNORM

R_7EhLsUJPlxMEG2Q,"Similarly, I would guess that the other participant would want the money just as much as I would. We can split it down the middle and each get rewarded equally.",SOCIALNORM
R_5CPpUYkP2H2Dnos,"We are partners and I don't think it would be fair or kind to give either of us more than the other, we are equals and should treat each other as such.",SOCIALNORM
R_79LS7ZeIhN8eu7T,"I do not know this individual, but this monetary compensation should be as fair as possible. With that being said, I am a senior and I believe I deserve $6 (compared to $5) because of seniority and grown-up tasks I complete on my own at my own expense.",OTHER
R_7KmckgF7vfgAQHn,"I again, thought it was fair to divide evenly amongst us to we had the same amount.",SOCIALNORM
R_69sT3qPj8TPjuS4,"i spoke to her right before the study. she seemed kind, i don't know her financial situation, and i don't want to be a greedy person and take resources all for myself",SOCIALNORM
R_7323u7jPhoHtjjV,"For the money, I think the more you get, the more value it has. I would be more likely to use $10 on something I actually needed or wanted than with $5. Overall, it makes more sense to have one person get all the money than splitting since the full amount is low.",FUNGIBILITY

R_3EBeyjxLYIErMf0,"Ten dollars really is not that much money and if we split it, that would be a win-win for both of us. I am not too concerned with the tradeoff of the other $5.",SATIATION
R_1rp5915ix5xNhyE,"In this section I once again divided the total evenly, giving myself $5 and giving my partner $5.

R_333vYseVqnP5ZrP,"I feel like we both need money equally; I don't know the financial situation he is in, so why would I deserve more.",SOCIALNORM
R_3gTmRtENTmOlIPx,"I split the $10 even ($5 and $5), because we could both benefit from the money. Plus, I don't know how we could spend it, because there are many different ways to, so it is easiest to just split.",FUNGIBILITY
