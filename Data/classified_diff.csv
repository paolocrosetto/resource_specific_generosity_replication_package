And for the minutes, honestly I thought about taking no time for myself and just getting the task over with, but again that would delay the other person and I kind of want to hear the music.",SOCIALNORM
R_6g7P7a6awguSMOf,I allocate a higher proportion of money than minutes off to the other participant. I did this because if they have less time off they can get more money.,FUNGIBILITY
R_7rGiyWbbc0PwEpU,"Its identical because they are almost identical scenerios. In both, there is no inherent reasoning to why either of us should have more or less of the split, so it should be split evenly.",SOCIALNORM
R_6KeDKfd1g0bOMf8,"There are 10 wasted minutes regardless, but only $10 total. I wouldn't mind much if I had to do something boring if I'm not getting out earlier, but I again would be very annoyed if the other person got more money.",PERISHABILITY
R_5Hv6KqUCHdO6Xol,"To me they felt like very similar scenarios. I was given something, the money or the music, and also given the ability to share it. As the other participant and I have no problem with each other I was inclined to split both evenly.",SOCIALNORM
R_5flYE7QRBjZd6bc,I wanted the treatment to be the same and fair,SOCIALNORM
R_6OPSvBizU5QR6Qs,I gave myself more time off than money due to the fact that I would feel bad. I feel I am a kind person and that is a good decision of me.,SOCIALNORM
R_5xUwNa2OIC7Y5Ut,"I allocated the same proportion of money as minutes because I don't know my partner that well, so I have no strong negative or positive feelings about them, so by allocating resources evenly for both things it is fair. Also, time and money are equal things in some people's mind, hence the saying time is money.",SOCIALNORM
R_3Sfr4X6gk7fJU7X,I did the same proportion since I did 50/50 to be fair. I think we should share more as a society.,SOCIALNORM
R_6nYLGVGy81waBdY,"I allocated the same because it doesn't make sense to me to be greedy in this type of situation. The amount of time or money difference is so miniscule that the guilt of taking more than the other person would get is not worth it to me, so I decided to just split it evenly for both.",SOCIALNORM
R_1xYL2SHs1Mvwug9,I allocated the same amount so that no one would feel like they got the short end of the stick. This way no one has anything to complain about or feel hurt by.,SOCIALNORM
R_30V30Du437EBDIz,i allocated lower because i think women deserve to be a little more spoiled and i would have more use for that money,DESIRABILITY
R_52tURThuN8N6FgA,"I allocated the same proportion of money as of minutes to keep it fair. I split it down the middle to keep it not only fair, but also for simplicity.",SOCIALNORM
R_6KC7ZJGxFmswTZI,I don't really see why I should have to keep more or give more. If it helps everyone then why not take that option? It's like how people complain about how some people get benefits or certain accommodations (eg. disability) when giving benefits/making things more accommodating across the board would make everyone's lives easier.,SOCIALNORM
R_6oTssSnLC6Suke9,I split the money even because I feel like there is no reason is give any more or any less. For the minutes I gave my partner extra just in case because I really don't mind doing boring tasks.,SOCIALNORM
R_3VfpP2CtPLhZxCR,"I allocated the same portion of minutes because it only felt fair.  I do not know this person, so I do not feel obligated to give myself more minutes and give them less.",SOCIALNORM
R_78SoANKUorQvplL,Same because its what you should do. We were picked for each other at random there was not a choice.,SOCIALNORM
R_6EWYl0HqAnAszfi,"I split them both evenly. I did this because I think it was the fairest option. Morally, I didn't want to be selfish.",SOCIALNORM
R_5IrYwSNnXp6SINP,"I allocated a higher proportion of minutes than money to my partner. I think I was more willing to sacrifice minutes of music because it is less valuable than money. I can listen to music whenever I want, so I don't need to listen to it more than my partner. But you can't just produce free money whenever you'd like, so there was a greater consideration for the split of money. I felt that in no situation would it be fair to give my partner less money than me, and if my partner gave me less money than I would feel injustice. The easiest way to minimize conflict would be to just each take 5 dollars.",FUNGIBILITY
R_3NycSHIo2oj317M,i value money more than relaxing music,DESIRABILITY
R_1GEbDt7cruwIO9O,I allocated same amount of money and minutes listening to music. What's fair is fair 50/50 is the best thing to do.,SOCIALNORM
