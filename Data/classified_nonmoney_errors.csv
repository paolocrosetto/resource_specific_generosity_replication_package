R_6BIfMXfAyE8fHm9,we were given an even number so it is only fair if we split them evenly,SOCIALNORM
R_71cIali32krfPjS,I split the 10 pens equally amongst the two of us. I don't really want or need more than like 2 pens but split equally to make it fair. I would later ask if they wanted more because I don't really need 5 pens.,SATIATION
R_6IjixZHQf4wh6Fz,Ballpoint pens are not that valuable to me. It made sense to me to just split them evenly.,SOCIALNORM
R_5nIB3Uug9ZUvusd,I feel like we don't owe each other anything and won't ever do anything together so we may as well be fair about splitting things up. If it were a friend my answer may be different depending on who.,SOCIALNORM
R_5HXJbE5vpnxOUuz,I think it is appropriate to share this time as the task is boring.,SOCIALNORM
R_6kKYL2nZMt2CLJv,"I wanted to be fair to both me and this other random participant, so I decided 5 minutes each. I did not want any distributive injustices, so I decided for equality.",SOCIALNORM
R_3OXu0AzMNOjvBAd,I didnt know this person and i would feel bad if i took all the minutes off,SOCIALNORM
R_3F312Mgj0skmq1m,i split it evenly so its fair and nice to both parties,SOCIALNORM
R_7MxGzf2rOo59Plg,I just split this in half to divide the work up evenly,SOCIALNORM
R_5G2s8RCCqbzbDOg,"Like the example above I thought it was fair to split it halfway. If we are given 10 minutes of music, why not split the time 5 and 5. This would be a fair decision to split up the time.",SOCIALNORM
R_6F2qRBjuqkfUGMe,I feel like I could deal with searching for the letter E and it would not bore me too much. And stopping to listen to music for not even that long would not be needed for me.,SATIATION
R_5eRLNd0GCC1WcUF,I gave us each equal amount of time off. I thought that was fair and she was friendly.,SOCIALNORM
R_6EHlFmzyNWGu9Jm,I split the time evenly because I feel it is the fairest. I don't want this person to feel offended to upset if I got more minutes than her so that is why I made it even. I think we would both be content with 5 minutes.,SOCIALNORM
R_5qfK1yWyr3c6iLd,"I decided to split to 10 minutes off total right down the middle, 5 minutes off for me and 5 minutes off for my partner. I decided to split it in half because I thought that would only be fair as we were both doing the same amount of work. It wouldn't be fair if one of us got a longer break despite having spent the same amount of time on this assignment.",SOCIALNORM
R_33jVdMtfu1y5gPv,I don't know my partner at all other than when we talked before coming in. I think since we are both in the same position of getting randomly put together and we are both participants in the same study it is only fair if we split the 10-minute music time into 5 and 5.,SOCIALNORM
R_3UqRyqHbaQE58eR,I gave the other participant 5 minutes. This was because there were 10 minutes in total between the two of us. That is the fairest way to split the minutes up.,SOCIALNORM
R_5VjCTIS0Bf7aJvH,i feel like it was only fair. this was i could spend half off and so could my partner,SOCIALNORM
R_3kNghLenr1hs9pc,"Again, if the study was very boring and we both had to endure it, I would rather us each have 5 minutes to listen to music. I feel that this is the fairest way to go about it.",SOCIALNORM
R_7W9SXUKxWNoRRFn,"I thought that if we were both doing the task we would tire less from both having time away for the task. While the time was given to me, I didn't think it was fair for me to get all of it while my partner was stuck doing more work.",SOCIALNORM
R_6msjMToXojQ8gUy,"splitting the time evenly is the most reasonable options. since i do not know my partner, i would prefer to split the time in the fairest way.",SOCIALNORM
R_6kOgobQCssl1cjS,it is fair to split it,SOCIALNORM
R_6qql59HU0vlg8jT,It just makes the most sense to me for the time to be split evenly between us. I would feel awkward taking more time than my partner.,SOCIALNORM
R_1FxZWcS32ruEz38,I split the time evenly so the both of us could have the same amount of time listening to music and also crossing out the e's in the paragraphs.,SOCIALNORM
R_31XVl4J0dvPrpIS,it is fair that we spend the same time doing the same task,SOCIALNORM
R_5aS9B3X8y9fFujy,"Again, I decided to split the time evenly. I can't really think of another way to do it that is not unfair or rude.",SOCIALNORM
R_3TY5MKTyAyltH1W,I think that splitting the time evenly is far as I do not want to be selfish. I dividing it is also the best way so there are not arguments.,SOCIALNORM
R_6wFSlXwjK1dhu0o,"As college students, pens are useful to us. Maybe I would ask the other person if they handwrite notes more often than I do and split it that way, but otherwise I think it is still reasonable to split evenly.",SOCIALNORM
R_7FFzvVGhril1ZOS,"I would have given more pens to the other participant, but I'm not sure they would need or even want more than 1 or maybe 2 pens for themselves, and I tend to lose lots of writing utensils, so I believe it would be most efficient to split that way. This way I could take the pens off their hands for them.",SATIATION
R_7oI3SIxeT9kjqu6,"Not that I necessarily need more pens, but splitting seems fair to me in this situation. When offered an even amount, splitting is always the best option to ensure fairness.",SOCIALNORM
R_5DV7FP8u3GnBTsB,"I also split the minutes in half. We each get 5 minutes, enough to listen to some music and relax, then get back to work.",SOCIALNORM
R_1Kqorv1h0N3VCjo,"I think the money is more important to split, so I didn't mind being a little greedy and keeping this to myself",FUNGIBILITY
R_3iWpSH1sh5gONV5,"i split the 10 minutes because i think it's only fair. it's a win-win situation as we are both getting shorter working time. i also really don't mind repetitive tasks, i actually think i would enjoy the crossing out e's task.",SOCIALNORM
R_3Du32NZXlwkOgYc,It's fair that we both get the same amount. If i took 7 and gave her 3 it would be unfair of me. If she got 3 and i got 7 it would be unfair to her.,SOCIALNORM
R_5e4f0PoBxZsWADp,"Again, the same reasoning for splitting with the money. If it were up to me, I will choose to split it.",SOCIALNORM
R_3HTVuLppb6n19tO,I think that it would only be fair to split the pens won because neither of us did anything more than the other to deserve the winnings.,SOCIALNORM
R_6LnA4wpJ6f61RHP,"I don't really care for ballpoint pens, so I split them up evenly between us. It wasn't money and I couldn't sell them so I would give them up.",SATIATION
R_5RUL6JSeeKlxhPi,"I split it in half so each of us get 5 pens. I felt that this was the most fair, but if I knew my partner needed pens I would give him more, because I don't necessarily need any.",SATIATION
R_5vJRWS9fAAfbizT,"I chose for each of us to get the same amount because it just seemed fair, I don't need ten pens. Since it's my first time meeting them I don't want to give them a bad impression I also don't know if they use or already have pens",SOCIALNORM
R_5Rxf6swqTpgn7eu,The other person could probably use those pens just as much as me so we should have an equal distribution.,SOCIALNORM
R_3PuaMLk5FFFTuLr,I would give him an extra pen becasue i do not need any. I wouldnt gve him all because he might not need the either.,SATIATION
R_5KDzKmKIqlJ7CVI,"Similar to the last answer, we just met each other and he was a good guy. I think we each deserve 50/50 in anything we get.",SOCIALNORM
R_1GDmg0yWgrk7XpC,I again chose to split the pens 50/50 as I gave myself 5 and my partner 5 as well. To me it makes the most sense to just divide them evenly.,SOCIALNORM
R_1pRIUcBLkzBGslq,"I feel for something as insignificant as pens, I would not be upset with sharing evenly with my partner, even if I barely know them. I also have several pens of my own and wouldn't need all ten for myself.",SATIATION
R_3rvsSVdwwMRM9j3,Because i dont need that much time and i give it to the other paticipant and it will maybe make her happy,SOCIALNORM
R_6HNtDJTxuJCJzo4,"I decided to make it even because if he wanted to listen to music as well. we would have even times, and nobody would be angry at how I distributed it.",SOCIALNORM
R_1f7f0W1THMlI2MO,I split the 10 minute break in half with my partner getting 5 minutes off and myself also getting 5 minutes off. I did this because it seemed most fair given we did not discuses our reading skills or speed or anything else along those lines.,SOCIALNORM
R_7NDHg8T2dpckpZA,"I want it to be equal. If I were the other person, I would want my partner to make the time equal also.",SOCIALNORM
R_3FywtBwaHkbRQ9U,I chose to split the time evenly. Seemed the most fair. Have no reason to keep all for myself,SOCIALNORM
R_7X6zVyVsXeOhyXD,"I don't mind doing mundane tasks. I would rather give my partner more time to enjoy themself, and less time doing a task they do not want to do",SOCIALNORM
R_50qhzjHXuDjXF2E,"I chose to distribute the 10 minutes evenly because that's what I believe is fair. I gave my partner 5 minutes and myself 5 minutes, and I think that is the best way to do it. I don't want my partner to think I am selfish, and I also would feel uncomfortable giving myself more break minutes than him.",SOCIALNORM
R_5dKRT3FoisVustS,I allocated this portion because I do not really need 10 ballpoint pens and I don't think she needs that many either so I split it down the middle. 5 ballpoint pens feels like a decent amount of pens to have.,SATIATION
R_6lxDAcSVNbDT0M0,Same reason as above,SATIATION
R_1I6x4xkaIgQyZCK,i dont need pens so since i kept money for myself i gave my partner all the pens to kind of make it up,SOCIALNORM
R_1gCrPV4wEYVBkuq,"Pretty much the same reasoning as above, this seemed easier to split since I don't perceive any monetary value with these pens.",FUNGIBILITY
R_7ootysCxs86SzAt,I split them in half because I feel like that is fair for the both of us. I would feel guilty taking anything more and not right to take anything less.,SOCIALNORM
R_5yP79ZGjvQwH6JH,I picked 5 each because it seemed fair splitting it in half. I think 5 pens is a reasonable amount to own,SOCIALNORM
R_5WHjQQwmmZED8DD,I distributed the 10 ballpoint pens equally between the two of us. I didn't want to be unfair or be selfish by keeping more than the other person so I thought we would just have the same amount.,SOCIALNORM
R_3vpAgqWygQQYYUN,"Since it's an even number, we can split it in half so that its fair.",SOCIALNORM
R_1PS55MupH6ok20F,we are both students and i have many pens at home,SATIATION
R_1DKXwjWEPgeXPFf,Split the time fifty/fifty,SOCIALNORM
R_71aEdDpuFA56mQh,"I would want to be fair with my partner, so I would allocate the time fairly and split it between the both of us. I do not like to be selfish and would want to make everything fair.",SOCIALNORM
R_7dx8QWh4NO25e1z,"For a scenario like this, people would usually divide the time equally since it would mean that everyone gets a chance to take a quality break. So again, I allocated 5 to myself and 5 to the other participant because I want to ensure I have a break at all.",SOCIALNORM
R_7BKEL9jJ9RqKPPr,I decided to give my partner 6 minutes of music. I gave myself 4 minutes. The reason why is because I don't necessarily need music to do a boring task.,SATIATION
R_7zbuQzH3WPlKswF,I was given 10 minutes so the most ethical and fair way to go about splitting that time would be to split it 50/50. My partner seemed kind so I think she would do the same.,SOCIALNORM
R_5VswU4tNRDDAZWZ,"I allocated myself 5 minutes off and the other participant 5 minutes off. I am not sure how the other participant would feel about the time off, so I split it evenly for fairness. I would have gave myself less time off because I don't really care, but I don't know how the other participant feels so I did not.",SOCIALNORM
R_77D4OQrPZvJLykE,"I gave both of use 5 minutes for each. It is fair, I don't know why either of us would be unhappy",SOCIALNORM
R_1gqjrSteEGFkXzd,"I feel like compared to the money; there is no true loss besides time in giving someone less. So, I split 70/30 music for me. I think that taking all the time to listen to music is wrong, however, in a situation where the only loss is time. I feel that it is fair to take more.",SOCIALNORM
R_7PUynF0fCaQhrQ2,It's someone I just met and an even split seemed to be the most fair. A 10 minute break is too long and I wouldn't get the job done as quickly if I took a long break and someone else took no break at all.,SOCIALNORM
