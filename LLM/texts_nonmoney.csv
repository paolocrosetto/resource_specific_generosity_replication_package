R_5gkFPADTS8ChOFG,i dont like oatmeal cookies that much i wouldve taken half just to give to a friend
R_7yNuX0OR7rZvvdT,"Same situation, I think it's the right thing to do. I wouldn't like if she gave me any less, so I won't do that to her"
R_6DvvLpE32XhfovG,Because I do not want the sugar packets. I also do not eat oatmeal.
R_3eQYiMpzbwQLOWu,I really like the brown sugar oatmeal packets and I am not sure if my partner does so I just decided to give one more to myself since I knew I would really appreciate it. If they also really like them maybe I would go back on that and split them evenly.
R_3PTNTTt4Jv1cQUx,I do not like brown sugar oatmeal
R_6SxbLLXTTD6eETY,I evenly distributed the brown sugar oatmeal because I already have several packets of instant oatmeal at home and this is less valuable to me than straight money. It seemed fair to evenly distribute it then 50/50.
R_7jNYCeh1AOup6yJ,I personally do not really like that type of oatmeal & I figure I would try 2 and then the rest he can have. If it does not like oatmeal maybe he has roommates or friends that can eat them.
R_5PcHHuUTeoKgTKK,"I have no desire for the packets. If my partner feels the same way she can throw them away or give them to someone else. If she wants them, she can keep them."
R_3CfIXPxSxaziz9T,"I think the brown sugar should be split evenly. regardless of what the product is, the best way to have both people satisfied with the result is by splitting it 50/50."
R_3qNH9SlfkTNMRGR,Split it evenly and felt that was fair to share
R_1ERsI5tKN5pw85g,"I don't really need these oatmeal packets, but I wouldn't mind trying them out."
R_5JgXhzrJXG3rozy,I gave us each 5 so we each get half so it fair for both of us. We ach get the same amount.
R_1HZeEIcEz4Xok3P,"I chose to do 5 and 5 because it felt fair. I am personally a fan of oatmeal packets, so didn't want to give them all away, but also didn't want to not give some to my partner."
R_7B8W4xhgpm3svgo,I thought it would be nice to share with them. Oatmeal is awesome
R_65HQsxqWpUUZyBX,"I allocated the portion of brown sugar oatmeal packets evenly between myself and the other participant because I believe that we both would want and use the product so it would only be fair to share. If there's an even demand between the two of us, then the item in question should be shared evenly."
R_139WcT7S0DVGvHL,I split them evenly. I thought this would be the fairest.
R_1in4gKFencMMvT3,it is the most fair if we split them evenly. even if neither of us want it it is the most fair.
R_7BVk9Sk10JpuwU1,I split them in half between us because the oatmeal packets are nice but they don't really have much significance to me (I don't need them)
R_3fPpqG32QKGtNRK,"I allocated only 3 to myself and 7 to my partner because I do not consume oatmeal very often at all. I enjoy oatmeal on the occasion, but I assumed my partner may have had more use for the oatmeal than I did."
R_6DOSRp2h1HvXM9V,I gave the other participant 5 packets so it would be equal. We both would receive the same amount.
R_6Les3rzd5SHp79y,I split it evenly. I don't know if he likes oatmeal packets. Me personally I am not the biggest fan but I will eat it if I have it available.
R_6EFwSIbHthmaJip,"I don't really like oatmeal, so I decided that I would keep a couple for myself and let my partner have the rest. In addition, I don't usually eat breakfast, so I thought giving my partner more might better benefit them then it would benefit me."
R_1vw0IEAZCnBpj2x,When asked to allocate the proportion of brown sugar I decided to split it evenly. I did this because I thought it would be fair.
R_1z6JOIfKtivi3pJ,"Because I took only $4, I also took 6 oatmeal packets. Also, I am interested in trying this cereal. Furthermore, we both get 10 items in total out of the 20 items."
R_6BNxp7RsNtqnFL3,"I can't eat oatmeal. So, I gave them all to my study partner."
R_1Gpqa2VKMIT7pwK,split it evenly
R_7CU9jTIdrOJlxgz,"I don't eat instant brown sugar oatmeal, so I would give all 10 to my partner."
R_702e3HpRGwgDr4N,"I still choose 50/50 share. I mean I am not a fan of sugar oatmeal, but I am not sure if she likes it or not. That's why I choose to give her half of the sugar oatmeal packets."
R_5HTSf1aFRRdFXFc,"I like oatmeal, but I'm not sure if she also likes oatmeal. Its best to just split it evenly at first, and if she doesn't like it, she could just give it to me."
R_6pfP0c4WEQwnAwY,"Same here, i divided the packets 505-0 so we each got 5. since I dont know my partner well at all, like if she likes or doesnt like oatmeal, if shes in need to food, etc., spliting in half seemed resonable and fair"
R_1BlChKHfQNZPS1y,"I am not the biggest fan of brown sugar oatmeal, so I decided to allocate more to my partner who may be a bigger fan. I think they was not point in splitting it evenly if I don't like it as much."
R_7WwszGq6tEjVUVX,"I gave my research lab partner all ten packets of brown sugar oatmeal packets, as I do not like instant oatmeal or individually portioned oatmeal. I would much rather have a tub of oatmeal to make myself, especially since I do not eat oatmeal often."
R_58M77OJw85aGRXI,"Again, i just wanted to be fair. I do not know what i would do with these packets but i wanted to be fair."
R_3ffRyxYhBevSK0z,Same as what I wrote above!
R_3g8ywbBwsGReQ0x,"I do not love oatmeal, and I figured since I don't my partner might so therefore I gave myself 2 and them 8 because I know I won't eat more than 2 and there is a chance my partner may really like oatmeal and want all 8."
R_3IC4dkEJ2DlJEVr,"I am a big fan of oatmeal as I eat it every day for breakfast. However my partner might like oatmeal, so I'd give her some but not a lot just in case she doesn't like oatmeal."
R_5Ey4DwBATJke6Xb,I don't care much about brown sugar oatmeal packets and so would just split them evenly. I have no reason to take any or give any extra.
R_7q1Fl3JSIVn3kxp,They are my partner and i would just split the packets in half with them if i was getting them for free.
R_1OoSljyK7oOTmJw,It only seems fair to give each of us five. Since we don't know each other well it makes it simpler to just split them.
R_6FEfys9CdrrQMm6,I have no use for brown sugar oatmeal packets. I would not eat them so maybe she would like them.
R_6kBW992pcIZrEH8,it is fair. My partner has good vibes.
R_3rpQNSlG3HVyfD3,"I decided to make it even because I wanted it to be fair, and I don't really enjoy brown sugar oatmeal too much."
R_6ldGa33LJQFHEmB,"Well, im not paired with anyone but if i were to be, I don't need 10 packs to myself. im trying to lean out right now, get that six pack right so I Wouldn't mind sharing some protein with someone"
R_3y4QwJmQv4tdSp3,"I decided to give her 9 packets and myself 1. I don't like oatmeal, so I have no use for them and thought she would want them (if she likes oatmeal). I gave myself one, though, to try hypothetically."
R_3EAGK3B0XohFw8P,"I actually just love oatmeal. So, I tried to be fair but took an extra packet for myself. Maybe my partner doesn't like oatmeal, so it'd go to waste."
R_3f6Cv41aqHs4bTm,"I would want the brown sugar oatmeal packets, but if my partner also wants them, I would want to split them equally."
R_6ON2HbvTAVaPGe1,I chose to give all of the oatmeal packets to my partner because I am allergic to oatmeal. I am unable to eat oatmeal.
R_63wCU7gNPmkiSv4,I do not enjoy brown sugar packets very much but will still appreciate them as something I could make in the future. I gave myself 4 and my partner 6 because I would not use any more than 4 packets.
R_1gT2ErxLXwPFSxt,I split it 50 50. It didnt say why to split it so that is the most even way to do it.
R_1JLzWhrk9YuPtLs,"I have her 8 and myself 2. Personally, I am not a big oatmeal fan, so I wanted her to get the opportunity to enjoy them as I would not."
R_7HRdvtd1YbBWwed,"Something like food feels a lot less abrupt to share with a stranger. I would be comfortable offering him some (1, but maybe more depending on the vibes) just as a friendly gesture, but I would honestly choose to keep most of the oatmeal as it is one of my common breakfast foods."
R_3Y2NMzaevqx8wbB,I mean since I am given the task to distribute the given product that I got for free and has cost me no liabilities I think it would only be fair to evenly distribute it to the other member who also is participating.
R_1o4HakvLg9bcfsc,"I think that 5 each is the most simple and fair way to distribute the brown sugar oatmeal packets. If I had any more, I would probably end up getting sick of it anyways."
R_3uK76hEd1Hdaiui,I thought it was only fair to give her half. It would be selfish for me to take all of the oatmeal
R_3dQc2WIfRWz40eT,"I dont need that many, give the rest to my partner."
R_1FIrccdG1FuTrAi,"Again, I split them evenly because that is what's fair. If my partner afterwards decides he isn't hungry and doesn't want all 5, then we can sort that out after they are distributed."
R_6K2sbpej2C9llZ2,"I gave myself 4 packets while giving the other participant 6 sugars because we still get a good number of packets where we both can be satisfied, and my preference is not that specific product, so I won't enjoy it as much as the other participant may which is why I gave them more."
R_6QrT6vn1XXRYCtk,i dont like oatmeal so 50/50 but if he wants more he can just have mine
R_7im1zR6fJdDkb2w,"I allocated 5 brown sugar oatmeal packets to myself and 5 to my partner because I believe that is fair to split the 10 packets evenly between the both of us. I would always try to split something evenly between us, and if there was an odd amount of packets, then I would happily take less and give more."
R_3ghgAICsL5S4Cld,"I think it is only fair if we share them equally. Even if she does not like them, she worked as hard as me and therefore deserves the same. If she does not like them, she can give them to someone else and she seems very nice."
R_7mn1yBYp9J9XI0U,I gave this amount to the other participant because I do not eat oatmeal. I figured it would go to better use if they had it.
R_5frwFXWxmKD5aMK,"I allocated 5 brown sugar oatmeal packets for each of us because I do not eat a lot of oatmeal. I wouldn't want more than a few oatmeal packets, so I thought I would share them with my partner. Maybe she likes oatmeal, and if not she would also only be receiving 5 packets."
R_3CK3AtTQQYIsmxX,I thought that both my partner and I would enjoy brown sugar oatmeal which is why I decided to allocate half and half to each of us so we would be able to enjoy the oatmeal. Making the distribution even ensures that we both get the equal ability to consume and enjoy the oatmeal.
R_1y7mXBCWma7EFyd,Because this is an expendable good and I think giving equal amounts is fair. She seems nice so I'm inclined to give more.
R_1JJgR09cPInpzdC,"Because I don't see a lot of value in brown sugar oatmeal packets but I would still make use of them, but I am willing to split them with the participant I was paired with"
R_3DI77O1x2wMbvJ8,i have never had oatmeal because i dont think i would like it so i just wanted one pack so i could try it and then the rest give to my partner because they may get more use out of it
R_5kN8Rgf2QiGNPle,"I don't think that myself or my partner care too much about oatmeal. If I knew him well enough to know if he likes oatmeal or not, my answer would have changed."
R_6uyoSXGGlqDUMwc,I decided to give my partner all 10 sugar oatmeal packets because I do not like oatmeal at all. Therefore I thought he would like all of them cause I did want them to go to waste.
R_1MkTKIO1gnol6Fj,I gave 5 to the each of us to keep it even.
R_5nIpN89BRbgRezs,I allocated 5 brown sugar oatmeal packets to the other participant and 5 to me because it is a fair split of the total packets given to me. We should both get the same amount unless the other participant needs it more than I do.
R_30Yj3pfG4qI5Da5,We would just split it 5 and 5. I don't need more than 5 and I think we would both be happy getting 5.
R_1sn5eY5Qye5YaxX,"I enjoy brown sugar oatmeal and when I make it I always use 2 packs of it, so having 5 packs at an even split would cause me to have an odd number, so I would rather give myself one extra and leave the other person with 4 so that we both have an even amount."
R_6ODlj4TDsokLso9,"5,5 its more balance"
R_7n00Pw4LDGVWMKb,"I don't like brown sugar oatmeal, so I'd be willing to give mine away to someone who might want them more than me. I don't want to waste the food but I'd also likely never have that many to begin with to where I'd need to share with someone else."
R_5mfxndJ1u3TKPgp,"I do not like oatmeal. I am not sure if my partner likes oatmeal, but I certainly don't."
R_3gSpV7ziUO4TrEJ,I think it will be beneficial if we both got an equal amount of food
R_1ruMd8AM8feoZEm,I indicated that I would give 5 to myself and 5 to my research partner. I mean its only fair if we both get half of what I can give out. Anymore or any less would be rude to one or the other person.
R_3bAgvOTfQNJnqb7,"I would evenly distribute them. I know I like oatmeal, but I did not ask her if she does so I am just assuming she likes oatmeal."
R_7QN5ue63VAznD0Z,"Again, I evenly split the oatmeal packets. I do not know this other pesron at all. I do not want to deprive them of something they may want. Considering I also want this, I do not want to short myself either, as I owe this other person nothing."
R_1pWVAAU80QPcUBT,I gave the participant half of the brown sugar oatmeal packets for two reasons. One was just because I'm not a huge fan of sugary things and also splitting halfway is the best method to do without an argument.
R_78WnPKQIrMvVAgV,Everthing should be shared.
R_3Xo0R7JymO7WI1Q,"Again, I chose to split the packets evenly. This way everything is fair."
R_66Fe9DjsUy62iC5,I would give each of us 5 because we were partners and both deserve and equal amount.
R_7rIx4NE1YvJbKNP,"I allocated this proportion because I felt that splitting the amount in half was fair. I did not know if my partner liked this food but if they did, I would want them to have the same amount"
R_7tgwxRyIU4w5V2o,i gave myself 5 because my girlfriend would really like them for breakfast. I gave grace 5 because she might like it too
R_1QqsXpP9BS7PxxT,I felt like it would be unfair to be handed 10 packets of oat meal and keep it all to myself. So I decided to split it 50/50
R_7EbPJtl1D1NeM32,I split the oatmeal packet evenly between my partner and I because that is the fairest option. I do not believe that I should receive more than her or vice versa.
R_50jE5ibMCCgpohN,I choose the number of oatmeal packets that each of us got following the same principle that I used in order to divvy up the money. I figured that a even 50/50 split where we both got five would be the fairest outcome.
R_5rCbe489DYpORJ4,"I chose to keep 4 because I don't really eat oatmeal but I didn't want to be unfair, so I stayed close to an even split. I feel like someone would not care if they received oatmeal or not."
R_1MF1uztVU6wmuf9,"On the flip side, I am not a big fan of brown sugar oatmeal. I gave her more to eat, now I got money for something I want to eat."
R_6OqymTybSiJXvxy,i do not particularly want or need the oatmeal packets so I gave her 6 and gave myself 4. I also can not eat oatmeal so I would be getting it for my roommates
R_3O6AamvSnjgLLoi,split even
R_6m4xma0yspfHysF,I gave the other participant all 10 brown sugar oatmeal packets because I would never use them. I figured the other participant would have better use for them or know someone else who would want them.
R_14c3DJ1WgORhZkZ,"Since I am not sure what we need the packets for, I would divide them evenly. It would not make sense to give more either way."
R_7foMaPI01qgv2v4,"I allocated this amount to the other person for multiple reasons. First, I do not consume sugar frequently. This makes me owning this sugar a complete and total waste. Second, I am allergic to gluten, soy, wheat, and dairy. This makes it challenging for me to use this sugar. Finally, I somewhat believe that sugar isn't healthy."
R_7S8qbgCyptzywG9,"I allocated them evenly because I don't have a need for 10 packets of brown sugar oatmeal. Also, it is fair to split it evenly."
R_1kGIL02BSmq29QI,I dont know if I like it. Plus 10 is a lot so why not share
R_52XAnmwZjuTAocQ,"Same logic, just gave them half. I don't know this person very well, maybe I like oatmeal more than them, but I don't know that so I just gave them half."
R_6IPUtF9QjuOQL5v,evenly because that is fair.
R_6f47OOirQQvytKm,"I did a 3/7 ratio for brown sugar packets of oatmeal because I would only want 3. I don't particularly like oatmeal, and I wouldn't want it to go to waste by going to me. There's probably a better chance of the other participant liking it than me. I chose the number 3 because I didn't want her to be stuck with either 10,9, or 8 packets, as that would be too much in case, the other participant didn't like them."
R_3lvoEbsMb6RymwV,These oatmeal packets do not have much value to me. It is worth more to share then to keep myself.
R_7eVkfq1XQMEF9jr,"I don't love brown sugar oatmeal packets but they are healthy, so I feel it would be best to split it evenly. It is fair and will benefit both of us if we get the same amount."
R_7ktcint08VIZ4Gm,I thought it was fair if we both get the same amount. I don't need any more than half.
R_5vkT6uXjsUPDUno,"I do not like brown sugar oatmeal. So, I hope my paired partner does that is why I gave her 10."
R_10wxgS8MFVqLskE,I think its fair to equally split the sugar oatmeal packets.
R_74co1xVKtdQmAW4,"I gave the other person all the brown sugar oatmeal packets because I am allergic to them. Hence, it would do them better to have than me."
R_5uPu9DJpFmbAEzm,I put that we would each get 5 oatmeal packets. So that we each gets the same amount.
R_3re8Wk0VdJzXpjr,"I dont know how much my partner likes oatmeal, nor do they know how much I like it. So in the interest of fairness I gave us the same amount."
R_6RfjNE7py35asmJ,i do not really eat oatmeal. I don't even have milk so this item would be useless to me.
R_736dYLAJNVzRCwh,"I do not see the need for 10 brown sugar oatmeal packets for myself. Taking them, all would be greedy, and I don't even like oatmeal that much."
R_6CQgey27sm8Jeyp,I split the oatmeal in half because it was the only way to split it fairly. Any other way is rude.
R_5gTz8lWLP6dZCDJ,"I don't like brown sugar oatmeal, so I don't want any. The other participant might enjoy it more than I would."
R_5aUDkpl0l4ld7gI,"I do not like brown sugar oatmeal. I think my partner does, so my guess is that he would want the majority of them if I didn't."
R_3YqYhTEbNjQkYnB,It is only fair that without knowing anything about the other person that we split the oatmeal up evenly. I do not have any knowledge or reason to take more or less than what we are both owed.
R_6OrJmydl0eDFR7N,Because I don't care too much about having them but they're nice to have in case. But he might like them so I would give him half to be nice.
R_5FVnOq6N2niLjTH,"Despite my fondness of brown sugar oatmeal packets, I feel morally obligated to at least split the packets evenly between the two of us. This is a fair decision in my opinion."
R_7VOBWb8p76aL4fT,"For myself I would not need 10 packets of oatmeal. I was thinking the same as the prior, by keeping it fair and splitting it down the middle. As maybe my paired partner likes brown sugar oatmeal."
R_31VrFxT4X1apThv,"I gave each of us 5 brown sugar oatmeal packets. I did this because I don't really care to much about oatmeal, but it is still food and so I decided that my partner and I would split it 50/50."
R_6GE5fnVYYLV7P9J,"I don't use brown sugar packets, so I thought maybe he could use them. If I would have them, they wouldn't be used."
R_5visovmegLKFM8F,I just think it should be an even split because I don't want to keep all the oatmeal for myself especially because I dont even think I would eat 10 packets of them
R_1Yb1nh3MFT0PbbG,"I split the oatmeal packets 50/50 because I don't necessarily place high value on the oatmeal packets. Again I like my partner, so I wanted to give her something."
R_7CfeJJsXE9doY5O,I dont really care that much about oatmeal so I just split it fairly so we each get the same amount.
R_1BbniTxZ1mwpXXz,"I would also distribute these evenly between the two of us. I had already met my partner a handful of times, so I would want to share my oatmeal packets with her so she thinks I am kind."
R_5pgL5tslRFTMMtv,"I imagine my partner would place little value on the oatmeal and wouldn't really care if I kept it. Furthermore, it's just easier to keep it than having to explain why I am splitting it."
R_65Xp6yACt6Vl2tr,I don't want to burden them with 10 so ill split it up fair
R_6hUWH8NAlcSKsLf,Yet again I just wanted to be even. The numbers could change if one of us doesn't like oatmeal.
R_52P9OeYQHuWG2Jv,"I like brown sugar oatmeal, so I wanted some for myself and assumed that my partner would want it too and gave her the equal amount to be fair."
R_1NWL4YKteSA6f4d,I split the oatmeal packets evenly because I think this would be the best moral and simple choice to do. We both get the same amount of oatmeal and we wouldn't need to worry about anything being unfair.
R_74imBdCiemuveRq,"Same as answer 1, I like Brown Sugar oatmeal, but It's only fair if we split between the two of us. Again, if he really liked them my answer would change, but splitting evenly is the most fair."
R_12uqXUe7afRuGHt,"I personally do like brown sugar packets, so I know I would want some, and i don't know if the other person likes them or not so I would split them in half to be safe. If it was something else I didn't care for then I probably would have given them all to the other person."
R_5ItGsCLbtGnj36h,"I don't really eat oatmeal, nor does anyone I'm close with. I decided to give all the packets to the partner because perhaps they may have a use for them while I don't. Even if they don't, they might know someone who would or could just give them away again if they're uninterested."
R_3Cfgzpc3UkqnyX6,"I had not introduced myself or met this person before, so taking all the oatmeal packets would not be morally wrong for me. I may be embarrassed if my choice was revealed to them, but I think my answer choice is not outlandish."
R_7rZvRofzdgrEvab,"I gave them half so it would be evenly divided. I'd want us to have the same amount, so it is fair."
R_5nTR8qdHfsp5B1N,I decided to split this one 5 and 5. I do not really care for oatmeal but I would still want a free oatmeal packet so that is why I decided 5 and 5.
R_6ZW745lUpmJxEXH,I do not need 10 oatmeal packets. I wouldn't want to keep all 10 if I had to. Why not give half to the other person.
R_1oNlKzvO6qkQIRw,"I don't really need the sugar oatmeal packs, so I decided to split them evenly amongst us. Maybe she needs a couple and could fins use of them at some point."
R_1qUG2BGu1jHr7qQ,"I dont really care for the brown sugar oatmeal packets, but I will take some if given to me. i split it because if it is something i hold little value to, i dont mind sharing. Splitting it in half is fair."
R_5EzXVlcrKNUyQ3f,"I like brown sugar oatmeal, but I already have some at home. Therefore, I don't need 10 more packets, but I know I would use at least 5 more packets."
R_6joGGi6BJN0kCf2,"I do not like oatmeal, so I would take 2 packets for my roommate who eats oatmeal and give the rest to the other participant. I have no desire to split the packets 50/50 but also do not want to walk away empty handed."
R_6SpNzAHTLtneDZ0,"I am not the biggest fan of brown sugar oatmeal packets, so I thought maybe my partner would like them more than I do. So I gave myself 3 and my partner 7."
R_5Xxkqu43uN6gI8N,it was the most fair 50-50. Nobody can get upset
R_3NVrfRHHDVkbB8a,so we will both have enough oatmeal packets. No one will feel unhappy or unfair
R_7rwuBZKiWQup25E,we were both randomly paired and no one did anything to warrant earning more than the others so we should split them evenly. i do not know if they even like oatmeal but the split initially should be even and then if one party decides they want to give some of theirs away they can
R_3U4qs6MoQxcDN6w,"I honestly just split it halfway because I know I wouldn't use more than that. Also, I wouldn't want to take that many just for them to go to waste."
R_6pQA102t0EL3gXM,I gave my partner 5 of them and myself 5 of them because evenly distributing something of that sort is being nice and thoughtful. I don't need more than 5 oatmeal packet's so giving him the same amount doesn't affect me.
R_56P3YhzJ91TIhj3,It's an even and fair split. I'm not overly concerned with how many packets I walk away with.
R_17wKBxjT2yFQIWG,"Once again, I wanted to keep it fair between the other person and myself. Without knowing the other persons preferences on food, I would rather assume that they would want some rather than take it all for myself."
R_52a2mT5Ujyd6SsF,"I decided to allocate 5 of the ball point pens to another participant (5 for myself) because that way it's an even share and each of us get something. I don't know any of these individuals personally or their backgrounds, so this seems like the best option."
R_6jesfZ5JS3w47EO,"I don't think someone needs 10 ballpoint pens, so I decided to split them. Also, I am a server, and I use pens a lot, so it would be nice to have more pens. 5 pens are enough, though."
R_1PuXbHrkwqFNFuN,Same reasoning as the money. Just split it evenly since there's no other reason to do it otherwise.
R_77wnZMeYrFmliGK,"I gave my partner all of the ballpoint pens because I have a lot already. I do not need any more pens, so this was fairest thing to do."
R_1owegpSVb9t0FTA,same reason as before I'm also not in need of 10 ballpoint pens so splitting them in half was the easiest thing to do. I didn't care enough to split it unevenly and figure out who gets more.
R_6hB8WIyXKXQ9enL,"Ballpoint pens are not something I am in desperate need for, and I doubt my partner is either so 50/50 seemed the only logical and fair way. They are a nice thing to have so I am sure she would enjoy them as much as I would."
R_7GByqCGVgjkLwSY,"i gave me and my partner each 5 pens, i personally do not need 10 pens so I chose to share"
R_7ZPPWyD7LaqvKr7,I gave us each 5 pens to split it evenly. It is fair that way.
R_3Qxs4wDAJZNTrBr,just half and half gonna be fine
R_1Izs124gCTzLqLq,I just wanted everything to be distributed evenly because that is the right thing to do.
R_7RaFFxIPEOJoa7i,I allocated five of the ten ballpoint pens to the other participant. I felt that I don't need all ten of them and as partners we could split them.
R_5QS4jRX3qahVSjn,"again, neither of us earned the pens. they all have the same amount of utility and it makes sense to just split it between us two"
R_5Ncn9VRWGVGo2Cl,I would give us both the same amount because I feel as if that would be fair and I don't need 10 pens.
R_5zKILD6GB8bLMXf,I believe that it is only fair that we get the same proportion of pens. I don't know the other participant well enough to determine if they have a greater or less need for the product.
R_1CaCkVfoe6JcvZv,"I always have pencils on hand but usually never pens, so I would benefit from having pens on hand. I also thought if I didn't have pens on hand, maybe others don't too. So, I gave 5 pens to me and 5 to my partner."
R_66fh3PITLpNaKWI,"Similar to the money, the pens were given for both of us. I also don't have any need for 10 pens."
R_6BIfMXfAyE8fHm9,we were given an even number so it is only fair if we split them evenly
R_71cIali32krfPjS,I split the 10 pens equally amongst the two of us. I don't really want or need more than like 2 pens but split equally to make it fair. I would later ask if they wanted more because I don't really need 5 pens.
R_6IjixZHQf4wh6Fz,Ballpoint pens are not that valuable to me. It made sense to me to just split them evenly.
R_6wFSlXwjK1dhu0o,"As college students, pens are useful to us. Maybe I would ask the other person if they handwrite notes more often than I do and split it that way, but otherwise I think it is still reasonable to split evenly."
R_7FFzvVGhril1ZOS,"I would have given more pens to the other participant, but I'm not sure they would need or even want more than 1 or maybe 2 pens for themselves, and I tend to lose lots of writing utensils, so I believe it would be most efficient to split that way. This way I could take the pens off their hands for them."
R_7oI3SIxeT9kjqu6,"Not that I necessarily need more pens, but splitting seems fair to me in this situation. When offered an even amount, splitting is always the best option to ensure fairness."
R_3Du32NZXlwkOgYc,It's fair that we both get the same amount. If i took 7 and gave her 3 it would be unfair of me. If she got 3 and i got 7 it would be unfair to her.
R_5e4f0PoBxZsWADp,"Again, the same reasoning for splitting with the money. If it were up to me, I will choose to split it."
R_3HTVuLppb6n19tO,I think that it would only be fair to split the pens won because neither of us did anything more than the other to deserve the winnings.
R_6LnA4wpJ6f61RHP,"I don't really care for ballpoint pens, so I split them up evenly between us. It wasn't money and I couldn't sell them so I would give them up."
R_5RUL6JSeeKlxhPi,"I split it in half so each of us get 5 pens. I felt that this was the most fair, but if I knew my partner needed pens I would give him more, because I don't necessarily need any."
R_5vJRWS9fAAfbizT,"I chose for each of us to get the same amount because it just seemed fair, I don't need ten pens. Since it's my first time meeting them I don't want to give them a bad impression I also don't know if they use or already have pens"
R_5Rxf6swqTpgn7eu,The other person could probably use those pens just as much as me so we should have an equal distribution.
R_3PuaMLk5FFFTuLr,I would give him an extra pen becasue i do not need any. I wouldnt gve him all because he might not need the either.
R_5KDzKmKIqlJ7CVI,"Similar to the last answer, we just met each other and he was a good guy. I think we each deserve 50/50 in anything we get."
R_1GDmg0yWgrk7XpC,I again chose to split the pens 50/50 as I gave myself 5 and my partner 5 as well. To me it makes the most sense to just divide them evenly.
R_1pRIUcBLkzBGslq,"I feel for something as insignificant as pens, I would not be upset with sharing evenly with my partner, even if I barely know them. I also have several pens of my own and wouldn't need all ten for myself."
R_7OquNTHMsxHHSLZ,"I decided to split the pens evenly between the 2 of us. I did this because I think it is the most just and fair way to split them, especially because I do not need 10 whole ballpoint pens."
R_32Muq6Y6gnckZL0,"I do use ballpoint pens but, i'm sure she does too. There is no need to have more then 5 pens each was my thought"
R_1CQhqeTbClkGsdR,"I would give me and the participant each 5 ballpoint pens. With each of us having 5 pens it helps to ensure that one of us isn't upset with the others amount. This way it is even, and no one is put in an awkward position."
R_5KvjkATw8t7EM5b,I chose to give the other participant more pens than me because I don't need that many pens so I thought giving her more would be nicer if she needed them
R_5uNInxm1rUOiqNC,the reason I split the pens up like that is because I do not use pens. that why I gave him the most because I would just waste them.
R_5004ViwSyLxP5GV,"I again chose to split evenly. I do not really need 10 pens, but I think we each could use 5."
R_72Y2IeZHOXIYibc,"I would split the pens assuming I was given them for coursework, and the other participant was in need of some."
R_6duFgQKXoXHcn0S,I would allocate 5 pens to each of this. This is the most fair way to decide what each person gets. Making it equal is the smartest way to make the decision.
R_1JeN4JJriYnl5Ti,"I would be willing to share pens with people. I can only use so many pens. So, it makes sense to share some with someone who might need it."
R_6vZYpEt1i30i9RO,"I don't really care about ballpoint pens which inclined me to split it evenly between my partners. I wouldn't know what to do with all of these pens, so I thought that it would be good to split it so we can distribute it between our friends and family."
R_3o25g8pqp0o6zAS,"I would allocate 5 of the 10 pens to the other participant for similar reasoning as we have 10 to split amongst the 2 of us. I have no immediate use for over 5 pens, so out of fairness I would be willing to dedicate half to my partner participant."
R_1jcb4o3YdMmlqG5,I just thought it would be fair. He gets 5 and I get 5.
R_6jqwPYzTBXDPlgB,I don't need to own ten pens. I would happily share them.
R_1PBdvqh30rzB7Vh,"Personally, I don't know what I would do with 5 pens, let alone 10. So it felt like the simplest choice to divide the pens amongst us evenly."
R_1N9YK0Ms5Qn24O0,"Both of us probably don't need more than two pens, so it's best to just split the 10 evenly and have 3 extra"
R_5LYwXdzgCScn7hW,"I would split the ball point bens down the middle, as I feel that is fair that we each get 5. The reason I believe that this is fair is because this is a gift and we both had no prior ownership, but it is a gift."
R_3rJOtojXi51bfIv,"I gave the other person all of the pens. I did this because I do not need ballpoint pens at all, so getting any wouldn't help me in any way, unless they are some really nice pens."
R_5dArMuO15CPgMKr,"Once again, I just split it in half to be fair (5 for me and 5 for her). I did this so I would not feel guilty about taking more pens and leaving her with less."
R_5HqvU7MEp91kr7a,"Similar to the other scenario, I would split the pens evenly between my partner and me. I have no use for 10 ballpoint pens, so giving half to my partner wouldn't impact me negatively and would allow them to have some for their own use."
R_65FV7Anb2apCFek,i don't care about having ball point pens and i doubt he does either so i decided to split them evenly
R_7v2336zpdg3pC4x,"Because I do not need 10 pens, and maybe the other person is in need of a pen."
R_1cjysXzNynGbFdq,I allocated half the pens between me and the other participants I was paired with. I did this because I feel like it was morally the right thing to do to share half with the person.
R_1jYvCR85auzyVDa,"I have no need for more than 3 ballpoint pens so I may as well split them up evenly. What if my partner has no pens at home so he needs 5, may as well make it fair."
R_5nCKgQjT8UgRTwt,I decided to split the pens up between us. I gave him 6 and myself 4 because I don't use pens that often.
R_60Iuo2PXsDFtFKQ,I chose to split it evenly. I did this because that's the fair way.
R_1q7Jr2YjkezRR2w,"I don't need that many pens. If my partner were around, I would split them with her. I did it evenly because I think it's rude to give away all of them, since it could get construed as I'm trying to get rid of junk."
R_7G6rdXvb2WE9i7F,I did 5 and 5. I wanted it to be equal.
R_7mW8gPkze59IeE6,I don't need 10 ballpoint pens. I am very specific about the pens I use. Therefore he can have half and I'll keep the other half for when people ask to borrow a pen in class.
R_5LLmwpU9G1WTwdg,"I could really only use 2 pens, they create clutter. If my partner wanted less than 8, I could be open to taking more pens."
R_7zIs6w72BGyCuK5,"Put others before yourself is what I believe in. Also, I don't need that many pens."
R_13Mems8JdCBG3XX,"I gave them 5 ballpoint pens as well, because again it just seemed fair to split them evenly. We both don't know each other so it's easier to split 50/50."
R_1nnoY3uohywtQ6R,Pens are something that we use everyday. It will take me a long time to even go through 5 so I shared.
R_3EWduXOxjyk26u2,"I distributed them equally, since we both need to do the study and put equal effort into it. In addition, I would also wish for the other person to share with me equally, so I am setting a positive example."
R_57AAiru2ik2O9Vf,"Same reasoning as the previous answer. I don't want to hold all the pens, so I will share."
R_33gyivh9W8nnve7,I split them both evenly so that we could both have the same amount of pens. I think that it was the fair and proper thing to do given the situation.
R_12nWCBToMTvHzUd,Splitting the 10 pens in half between us was the idea. I personally do not need 10 pens all to myself.
R_5Q6kI007juCSTtx,"It was for a similar reason. She is a participant and know how much I would have taken, so I do not want her to be upset or a bad impression if I take too much. I don't really need a pen, and I am not sure if she does, so I figured we could just split it in half (fair)."
R_5sUdSEAJx37b50a,"I gave each of us 5 pens because he seems like he needs some more pens. He commutes to school and therefore, it seems as though the more pens the better. I needed 5 pens because I like writing in pen and I lose them fast."
R_6dIfH3gLe29ihLH,"I allocated 6 pens to the other participant. This is because I would take a few, but I don't need many pens."
R_3Dbvrz3vTEnCudu,"I don't have any use or need for pens, I only use pencils."
R_3QJHEs8JgURm8WF,"I thought of this one the same way as the dollars. Because we don't know each other very well, it makes sense to me to split the pens evenly."
R_6ekcmtycYXMVHJD,I don't care to have more than my partner as a ballpoint pen isn't very important to me.
R_31fgDUEV4fyZFBv,"Like the $10, I split the ballpoint pens equally between us because I felt like it was the right thing to do. I also do not have a personal use for all 10 pens and thought the other person, who is a fellow student, would appreciate having them."
R_7Fu3cilVl8t2LBi,"She may need some pens as well. They are very useful, and I would like her to have just as many."
R_5DZviTMJCc4mzxC,"I split this even as well, for the same reason that I split the bills even. I know that I could use a few pens for my work now and in the future, and my partner might too."
R_6MLGD005V4oMhPA,"Since it's me and only one other person, 10 pens divided by 2 people is 5 pens a person. However, my other logic that I used is that I personally don't need many ballpoint pens, so splitting it up down the middle is easy and fair."
R_1VBCcbo8kJWQRd3,"I split down the center to keep it fair, so we get an equal amount."
R_31mqQNtXiaNDvyB,"The person that I met was nice and easy to talk to. So, I figured we should have an even split of the pens."
R_5bV3hF4RZdnCPPO,"At first, I thought I would give her 7 and only take 3 for myself since I don't really need them. However, I realized that she may not need them either. It only made sense to split it 5 and 5 when we don't know how much each other wants/needs."
R_5pE6M5MtgyeOLMe,"I said I would take 4 and they can take 6, because I already have some ball pens and I do not need many more. I figured I could take some and they could take the rest. I originally put that I take 3 and they take 7, but that seemed like too much and that they probably wouldn't want 7 pens."
R_37h7KeGM3lLFgTT,"I just thought that it would be best if we evenly split what we were given when we were together. I don't need all the new pens either because I already have pens that I like to use, which is also why I didn't choose to allocate more to myself."
R_3YXuAls6aqx6HIa,"Then we will have an even amount, and I don't need 10 pens"
R_1Apjhgn7I9gIE3T,I split them evenly because that is fair and I don't know why a person would need more than 5 pens at once
R_1lZUsUPigHomyiZ,"Because I don't think I need too many ballpoint pens, so I choose to distribute it fairly."
R_6HBNs1JOenfx2Kc,I don't know what they are so I just gave them away.
R_6o7pZVkZa6FIbhL,i'm sure he needs pens so i allocated some to him. i also gave him 3 pens because i do not need all 10 of them.
R_1Eyj1iiInL4hlKz,"To distribute the 10 pens, I chose to give myself 6 because I use pens often and they run out quickly. I do not know the other person's usage of pens, but I assumed it was probably less. Additionally, I gave myself 6 pens because 5 would have been an even split and I felt I deserved more."
R_6Nhr4PsJ8LEoe7a,"I always need some new pens, but I didn't want to be selfish so I gave the other participant 7, and myself 3."
R_7YJkkoFBcs1AhA5,Splitting up the pens evenly is the most fair. The pens would make no difference to me.
R_3R9jIJa44nfs8pP,"I do not need any of the pens, so I gave all 10 to my partner. Since I do not need them, I didn't see the point in keeping any to myself"
R_3E4ndeq7iwlGRek,I gave 5 ballpoint pens to both of us. I did this to keep things equal.
R_3C28cmPxYJrTsSy,I decided to spilt the ball pens evenly because we have the same class and need it to write.
R_7Q0KNcwFENdFYbS,"I do not know this person, and there is no incentive outside of this study, so splitting seems the most rational decision."
R_6dmNDZNETS29MBO,I also evenly divided the 10 ballpoint pens between the other participant and myself because I do not need all 10 for myself. An even 50/50 split makes the decision easy and leaves both parties leaving with more than they had.
R_7tsbJYkwDT0mrSg, I split the sum in half between us. I did this because its fair.
R_7KLyh9zZONWoeQ1,Dont have an interest or want in ballpoint pens. So i split it 50/50
R_7QGy7baxYxje71n,"10 pens is a large amount, and I really don't need all 10 of those for myself. I use only one pen at a time so having two extras seems like a good amount for me to keep. I gave the other person 7 because I don't want any more."
R_6CrcILUzdu3TwYh,I usually do not use pens; I'd rather give it to someone else in case they may need extra.
R_1rv3PwiOhWkCz1w,"If I have 10 pens and 2 people, 5 pens per people seems fair"
R_1EL999ksllBioH9,"I split them evenly because I'm always in need of a pen but anything more than 5 ball point pens is just too many, I prefer gel anyways.  I also thought that they might need a pen, it definitely couldn't hurt in school but giving them too many pens might be too much for them.  I wouldn't want them to throw them out or something if they didn't have use or just be upset because they got stuck with a bunch of pens.  So, I figured if I split it evenly it's a win win."
R_14issEJrXpDGDXT,I decided to split the amount of ballpoint pens evenly. This means we would each receive 5. I think fairness is important and there is no reason why one of us should receive more than the other person.
R_6eLgcCQkNvrgMrE,It seems fair. We both put in same work/effort and had a good conversation.
R_58ZH34UwsgOlua9,I chose to get 7 ball point pens because i often lose pens/ pencils and i could use them. I gave him three because it is not right to take all of them.
R_7fD07WU2BHnrOE1,It is only fair that we both receive equal amounts of ball point pens. I would be very sad if my partner did not also share 5 pens with me.
R_138O30aAad6sXFi,I thought it was just fair.
R_5AxZeYO1PZGBr8t,It seems the most fair to have the same amount of ballpoint pens. We both probably have enough ballpoint pens so it wouldn't be rude to share the same amount. It could be rude giving someone more than the half making the pens seem to be less valuable.
R_7U3AWsnOVMI7Fo8,It is even split and fair
R_7eOS2mSLrCD3gwh,"I decided to split the 10 pens because its a lot of pens. If we are randomly partnered, neither of us did anything to deserve more over the other, so I kept it equal."
R_5Li2J2EWjSAXOkj,"I picked to split the 10 ballpoint pens evenly between us, so 5 for me and 5 for my partner. I did this because I think it was only fair that we both get the same amount, and no one gets more than the other. I would not want someone to get mad or jealous for not getting the same amount, so the right thing to do is split it evenly."
R_39P74NKaLpPLunL,"There are 10 ballpoint pens total, I think the 5 vs. 5 for two of us is fair."
R_6HzrYRfPUPGqzVQ,My value of pens is significantly lower than my value of money. I have almost too many pens and so it is in my interest to give pens away rather than keep them all.
R_3XV1lVKMJW4Vgk1,Neither of us indicated a want/need or lack of want/need for pens. I'm assuming we both use them so it's fair that we split them.
R_1VCOXoB5X9Kwg7o,I choose to only give myself 2 pens since I have many pens and pencils already and don't need them. I felt it fair to not take a resource I need and instead give it to someone who may better benefit from it.
R_524x5XFRxXUcgVh,"Getting 10 pens is a lot of pens. With the same principle as the money, I think it's only fair that we split the pens equally."
R_7F6HMSmBs1PtO0x,I gave myself 6 pens because I know I have only two pens right now. I lose my pens often and having more would help. I also go through pens fairly quickly.
R_7JKoyjKFQCvQdJP,i definetly dont need more than 5 ballpoint pens for any reason. and its the same idea as the dollars. an even split.
R_3hrUXlugrtOAqh1,I don't really use pens but she might. I think they would be of more use to give to someone else.
R_5uVS7VdkVoTg8pn,I gave them 8 because I do not see the need of using ballpoint pens myself. Not knowing this person they could need them so decided to give them the majority.
R_5zMD7SzDZaj1s7v,I gave them 3 because I wanted more than them and I am also just greedy.
R_5M6QhD1h3m4GswV,i get to distribute so i can have an extra one
R_7Gqh4Z8nvoQoRkB,"Well, they are just pens and I don't need 10 and I'd assume he probably doesn't need 10. Thus, I chose to just split them."
R_53irJOPhVjnD9MR,I think that it is only fair for it to be equal. We were both given the same number of pens and it is a even number so it worked out okay.
R_5mdDsNTPibpzaZJ,I think it is just the fairest option to equally split the pens. I don't think either of us need any more than 5 pens anyways.
R_78KJ0oTZhAcYIbn,"I feel like pens are useful for every student. 5 for each of us seemed fair. I honestly wouldn't even want/need that many, but it also felt excessive to leave someone else with more than 5 pens that they might not want."
R_3rGUaaqe7RNOrHw,"I split it evenly. I don't really need ballpoint pens, and I am not sure if they do either. However, I split it in the middle so that it's fair."
R_6oyZ1KW1UbGQgoA,"Again, this is the same thing, we can bond by me giving him 9 ball point pens. Gave him 9 because I only need 1."
R_1H8lUcum5vHILLj,"I chose 5 pens for the each of us. This is because we each get the same amount, making it fair and equal."
R_5mRFTejKaVw0SGJ,I like things playing fair and just
R_7xPsyuCWOtI1yQ8,1.i feel good to allocate ballpoint. i can get good experience
R_50NzY5Kw2QVWR45,Pens don't have a ton of value and there is no reason for me to have all ten pens to myself. I honestly could have given him more as I have pens and pencils.
R_5nZZZuO81zsf4GJ,"Once again, I think greed is bad even when it is with something small as a ball point pen. These pens could last me a long time and I'm sure the other random person would also benefit from this."
R_6sdrMPZbbcjuwKb,I allocated 5 ballpoint pens to myself and the other participant because it felt like doing it evenly was the best way. I do not need more than five pens and I would have been willing to give the other participant more if she needed them but I do not see a need for either of us to have more than five pens.
R_1FLqGno7JDQAYq0,"I gave them the same amount that I would give myself. This keeps things even and fair, since any other way wouldn't guarantee the same outcome for both of us."
R_5dKRT3FoisVustS,I allocated this portion because I do not really need 10 ballpoint pens and I don't think she needs that many either so I split it down the middle. 5 ballpoint pens feels like a decent amount of pens to have.
R_6lxDAcSVNbDT0M0,Same reason as above
R_1I6x4xkaIgQyZCK,i dont need pens so since i kept money for myself i gave my partner all the pens to kind of make it up
R_1gCrPV4wEYVBkuq,"Pretty much the same reasoning as above, this seemed easier to split since I don't perceive any monetary value with these pens."
R_7ootysCxs86SzAt,I split them in half because I feel like that is fair for the both of us. I would feel guilty taking anything more and not right to take anything less.
R_5yP79ZGjvQwH6JH,I picked 5 each because it seemed fair splitting it in half. I think 5 pens is a reasonable amount to own
R_5WHjQQwmmZED8DD,I distributed the 10 ballpoint pens equally between the two of us. I didn't want to be unfair or be selfish by keeping more than the other person so I thought we would just have the same amount.
R_3vpAgqWygQQYYUN,"Since it's an even number, we can split it in half so that its fair."
R_1PS55MupH6ok20F,we are both students and i have many pens at home
R_1DKXwjWEPgeXPFf,Split the time fifty/fifty
R_71aEdDpuFA56mQh,"I would want to be fair with my partner, so I would allocate the time fairly and split it between the both of us. I do not like to be selfish and would want to make everything fair."
R_7dx8QWh4NO25e1z,"For a scenario like this, people would usually divide the time equally since it would mean that everyone gets a chance to take a quality break. So again, I allocated 5 to myself and 5 to the other participant because I want to ensure I have a break at all."
R_7BKEL9jJ9RqKPPr,I decided to give my partner 6 minutes of music. I gave myself 4 minutes. The reason why is because I don't necessarily need music to do a boring task.
R_7zbuQzH3WPlKswF,I was given 10 minutes so the most ethical and fair way to go about splitting that time would be to split it 50/50. My partner seemed kind so I think she would do the same.
R_5VswU4tNRDDAZWZ,"I allocated myself 5 minutes off and the other participant 5 minutes off. I am not sure how the other participant would feel about the time off, so I split it evenly for fairness. I would have gave myself less time off because I don't really care, but I don't know how the other participant feels so I did not."
R_77D4OQrPZvJLykE,"I gave both of use 5 minutes for each. It is fair, I don't know why either of us would be unhappy"
R_1gqjrSteEGFkXzd,"I feel like compared to the money; there is no true loss besides time in giving someone less. So, I split 70/30 music for me. I think that taking all the time to listen to music is wrong, however, in a situation where the only loss is time. I feel that it is fair to take more."
R_7K3euBwkELsI7AZ,i allocated that time because it is the fairest and me and the other person deserve to have an equal portion of work
R_12EswaFCxqS2pC9,I offered a 50/50 split. I did this because it is fair to both parties.
R_7YmIaW8ojtDsHlA,It seems fair to divide it evenly between us if we both have to do the same boring task. I would feel guilty not dividing the time up that way.
R_74NPbcqogVfHPeE,I allocated more time for listening to music to myself because I do not really know my study partner.
R_6Qn93cSFob3sMxe,Again I split the time evenly so we could each get the same amount of time of pleasant music. This is the fair way of doing things.
R_68HsBfwDka3Froy,It would be fair to split evenly so that we both worked on it. I do not want my friend to spend more time on a task knowing I could help out.
R_3rhAwIQWRpfxGN3,"Same thing as last question, I feel like if we both get 5 minutes of break time, it would be fair. If I were to get more or vice versa, it would not be fair."
R_7EhLsUJPlxMEG2Q,"I don't know the other participant very well, but I imagine she would also want time off from doing the very boring task. Five minutes each would be the most fair way to split up the time."
R_5CPpUYkP2H2Dnos,"We are partners and I don't think it would be fair or kind to give either of us more than the other, we are equals and should treat each other as such."
R_79LS7ZeIhN8eu7T,"Because if we were both doing the same task, I think we both deserve the same amount of time to relax. Plus, listening to calm music does not have any personal connection or value to me in this scenario."
R_7KmckgF7vfgAQHn,I thought it was fair to divide the time evenly between us.
R_69sT3qPj8TPjuS4,"i think i might actually enjoy the menial task and it's only for 10 minutes, so i thought she might be able to enjoy the music time more thoroughly than i would"
R_7323u7jPhoHtjjV,I chose to split the 10 min evenly between me and the other participant. If I were in the other position I would want someone to choose this method too.
R_6eVgBjwZBGkb44e,"I feel like it is most fair to split it up 50/50. Especially is we were both offered it, it would feel stingy to take it all."
R_5dzPVJgchQQZ16M,"it is fair to split the ten minutes evenly. since i dont know the person i was paired with very well, i do not know if she enjoys the task and would like less time off or hates the task and would like more time off."
R_3Ldpccf1oD6feQd,"This is the same situation, I know they are aware of the choice I had to make and I always want to be kind and caring, because I would want the same done for me."
R_3EBeyjxLYIErMf0,We are all here for the same reason I feel it would be a little rude to allocate more time to myself to get to listen to music. I also think only 5 minutes of crossing off e's would not be that bad after all.
R_1rp5915ix5xNhyE,"I allocated both myself and my partner 5 minutes off. I did this because the amount provided to us, 10 minutes, could be easily and evenly divided between the two of us. It is not fair in my opinion to distribute the allocated minutes in any other way"
R_333vYseVqnP5ZrP,"Pretty much the same answer as the previous; its only fair that we both get the same amount of time listening to pleasant music, unless they like to cross out a bunch of e's for fun"
R_3gTmRtENTmOlIPx,"I allocated 6 minutes because repetitive tasks are sometimes easy for me, so I wouldn't need too long of a break. However, I don't know my partner well and they might enjoy listening to the music. If they don't, it wasn't too much additional time anyway."
R_5QYsET58CKW5exo,"I chose to give the entire 10 minutes to my partner because when I was talking to him before starting the surveys, he seemed like a very kind person. Furthermore, I would not mind finding and crossing out the letter 'e' in multiple paragraphs of text. Honestly, I would find that kind of relaxing."
R_63WeIchcsZxH4er,I wanted to evenly distribute the amount of time amongst me and my partner. I wanted it to be fair.
R_3dubWwCxmu0kzO4,"Again, I split these minutes in half for the same reason as above. Mainly because it is fair that way and neither one of us would feel as though we were robbed."
R_3rvsSVdwwMRM9j3,Because i dont need that much time and i give it to the other paticipant and it will maybe make her happy
R_6HNtDJTxuJCJzo4,"I decided to make it even because if he wanted to listen to music as well. we would have even times, and nobody would be angry at how I distributed it."
R_1f7f0W1THMlI2MO,I split the 10 minute break in half with my partner getting 5 minutes off and myself also getting 5 minutes off. I did this because it seemed most fair given we did not discuses our reading skills or speed or anything else along those lines.
R_5nIB3Uug9ZUvusd,I feel like we don't owe each other anything and won't ever do anything together so we may as well be fair about splitting things up. If it were a friend my answer may be different depending on who.
R_5HXJbE5vpnxOUuz,I think it is appropriate to share this time as the task is boring.
R_6kKYL2nZMt2CLJv,"I wanted to be fair to both me and this other random participant, so I decided 5 minutes each. I did not want any distributive injustices, so I decided for equality."
R_3OXu0AzMNOjvBAd,I didnt know this person and i would feel bad if i took all the minutes off
R_3F312Mgj0skmq1m,i split it evenly so its fair and nice to both parties
R_7MxGzf2rOo59Plg,I just split this in half to divide the work up evenly
R_5G2s8RCCqbzbDOg,"Like the example above I thought it was fair to split it halfway. If we are given 10 minutes of music, why not split the time 5 and 5. This would be a fair decision to split up the time."
R_6F2qRBjuqkfUGMe,I feel like I could deal with searching for the letter E and it would not bore me too much. And stopping to listen to music for not even that long would not be needed for me.
R_5eRLNd0GCC1WcUF,I gave us each equal amount of time off. I thought that was fair and she was friendly.
R_6EHlFmzyNWGu9Jm,I split the time evenly because I feel it is the fairest. I don't want this person to feel offended to upset if I got more minutes than her so that is why I made it even. I think we would both be content with 5 minutes.
R_5qfK1yWyr3c6iLd,"I decided to split to 10 minutes off total right down the middle, 5 minutes off for me and 5 minutes off for my partner. I decided to split it in half because I thought that would only be fair as we were both doing the same amount of work. It wouldn't be fair if one of us got a longer break despite having spent the same amount of time on this assignment."
R_33jVdMtfu1y5gPv,I don't know my partner at all other than when we talked before coming in. I think since we are both in the same position of getting randomly put together and we are both participants in the same study it is only fair if we split the 10-minute music time into 5 and 5.
R_3UqRyqHbaQE58eR,I gave the other participant 5 minutes. This was because there were 10 minutes in total between the two of us. That is the fairest way to split the minutes up.
R_5VjCTIS0Bf7aJvH,i feel like it was only fair. this was i could spend half off and so could my partner
R_3EcZowlZLQR82YC,"I would feel bad giving someone else too much of a workload that I can take on myself. It also was not a horrible load, it can be tolerable."
R_1tyR7atVhAT7kf3,I don't know this person but we chatted before the study and she was very nice. I am also a fairly nice guy so I am happy to split everything evenly. I think that is probably the best way to go with anything.
R_6nNIVzAHk9OSqOG,"same thing with the money, being fair"
R_7PUynF0fCaQhrQ2,It's someone I just met and an even split seemed to be the most fair. A 10 minute break is too long and I wouldn't get the job done as quickly if I took a long break and someone else took no break at all.
R_3kNghLenr1hs9pc,"Again, if the study was very boring and we both had to endure it, I would rather us each have 5 minutes to listen to music. I feel that this is the fairest way to go about it."
R_7W9SXUKxWNoRRFn,"I thought that if we were both doing the task we would tire less from both having time away for the task. While the time was given to me, I didn't think it was fair for me to get all of it while my partner was stuck doing more work."
R_6msjMToXojQ8gUy,"splitting the time evenly is the most reasonable options. since i do not know my partner, i would prefer to split the time in the fairest way."
R_6kOgobQCssl1cjS,it is fair to split it
R_6qql59HU0vlg8jT,It just makes the most sense to me for the time to be split evenly between us. I would feel awkward taking more time than my partner.
R_1FxZWcS32ruEz38,I split the time evenly so the both of us could have the same amount of time listening to music and also crossing out the e's in the paragraphs.
R_31XVl4J0dvPrpIS,it is fair that we spend the same time doing the same task
R_5aS9B3X8y9fFujy,"Again, I decided to split the time evenly. I can't really think of another way to do it that is not unfair or rude."
R_3TY5MKTyAyltH1W,I think that splitting the time evenly is far as I do not want to be selfish. I dividing it is also the best way so there are not arguments.
R_7NDHg8T2dpckpZA,"I want it to be equal. If I were the other person, I would want my partner to make the time equal also."
R_3FywtBwaHkbRQ9U,I chose to split the time evenly. Seemed the most fair. Have no reason to keep all for myself
R_7X6zVyVsXeOhyXD,"I don't mind doing mundane tasks. I would rather give my partner more time to enjoy themself, and less time doing a task they do not want to do"
R_5DV7FP8u3GnBTsB,"I also split the minutes in half. We each get 5 minutes, enough to listen to some music and relax, then get back to work."
R_1Kqorv1h0N3VCjo,"I think the money is more important to split, so I didn't mind being a little greedy and keeping this to myself"
R_3iWpSH1sh5gONV5,"i split the 10 minutes because i think it's only fair. it's a win-win situation as we are both getting shorter working time. i also really don't mind repetitive tasks, i actually think i would enjoy the crossing out e's task."
R_50qhzjHXuDjXF2E,"I chose to distribute the 10 minutes evenly because that's what I believe is fair. I gave my partner 5 minutes and myself 5 minutes, and I think that is the best way to do it. I don't want my partner to think I am selfish, and I also would feel uncomfortable giving myself more break minutes than him."
R_5e8DGUvH3lxyd8B,Because we are a partner and this proportion is fair for everyone.
R_771hcydHvfBqai1,"I chose to split the times of pleasant music evenly because if we are both doing the boring puzzle then we should both take breaks equally. If one person takes a longer break, the other person might feel it is unfair and end up not doing the work well."
R_7G1uPcNKWJ9oEtX,"I don't know the person who I am splitting time with. So, I would just go half and half so it's a win-win."
R_5egYmijLoMjvl5P,I felt 5 minutes each was an even split. I don't know this person well enough to not make it even.
R_3ySxE7Hsqfv7ynv,I felt as if the allocation of 10 minutes was not something that I cared very much about. I also don't know how much my partner cared about the amount of time. It felt fair to split it evenly.
R_6DTw95ROdU3LHLt,I also split the minutes I was given in half so that it would be even. Since the music was given as a reward it is only fair that we each get the same amount.
R_3KopMtmn3U0D9qe,I split it evenly because it is fair. Nobody has the right to get to listen to music for longer than the other. We must suffer together and enjoy music together for the same amount of time.
R_7ie5ZMQvGHXQUFj,"I would just split it evenly to be nice, I could use the 10 minutes of music but that would be selfish and I would like to be nice and can get through 5 minutes of nothing to do or listen to."
R_6FhCE5HCjgxrO3n,I think it's only fair for us to both have equal amounts of time listening to music. She was nice and friendly.
R_5SM4ZnPt3qROXkd,Half and half
R_6aII1KiYNTaXAvX,It is only ten minutes. I would rather make them happy and just do the quick task. I would take two breaks for a minute or just use it all at the end.
R_6DOzz06wYRlG72z,"I wanted to be even. My partner seemed like a really nice person, and I did not want to rip them off. We are both doing the equivalent amount of work here."
R_6ZLo9usiNV2d7rj,"Again, I let us each have 5 minutes enjoying music rather than splitting it unevenly. It's the fair thing to do."
R_6PtumLnkRDe4xnu,"I don't know him all that well, and it would be unfair to either of us if the minutes allocated for each of us to be unequal."
R_1f39u8tAHLyMru3,I chose to split the 10 minutes off in half (so 5 mins each) because that is the most fair and right thing to do. That decision is free of all biases and equal.
R_5kvoAoW1mi8rLpy,I gave us the same amount of time because that means we could have equal breaks from doing the boring task. It would help us both stay motivated to complete the task.
R_6wzS8DyiVPpmHcG,I remain the same rule to allocate the time fairly to each of us so that we can get the same time to finish the tasks.
R_1P7VVLZ7umCRzrt,Because I just met this person so I do not want to seem selfish or rude. It is also not fair of me to take all the rest.
R_3QusKeonMjyUOQq,It was fair and even and I knew we would both want a break
R_6lbGEDxDzDN7twB,"We are all going through the same thing, and I am a fair person who would feel bad if I took some time of music away from them. I think they would be appreciative and unselfish doing the same for me."
R_6j6CfdZu0bEV1Fr,i don't need the 10 mins off because it's not a difficult task and it's just 10 minutes
R_1PCfYbr6b2XdjeL,"If we are both doing a very boring task, I would like him to also have the chance to have a break"
R_5bKaCeFEtexMdTh,10 minutes would go by fast regardless of the task so I don't mind crossing off e's in a paragraph while my partner listens to music
R_1dp1i7kVWXId2hd,"I gave her 5 minutes and me 5 minutes. It's the same reason for the money, it's fairest to allocate evenly."
R_7IQq9jTZgNEgILv,I gave 5 minutes to each person. I did this because it is what is fair.
R_7QVGAUO4ylSpl58,I allocated 5 minutes for myself and 5 minutes for the other participant. I chose to do this because I wanted each of us to be given the same amount of time to choose what music we wanted to listen to.
R_3cc2j5Y4w4eP5fj,i think we should both get some time off but i would rather get the extra minute off compared to him. this is probably because i just met the guy but still would give myself the extra bit of time.
R_7t3Cbq8APpo6iCP,"I allocated the minutes of music to listen to evenly between the both of us for fairness. Since we both have to work on this boring task, it is only fair that we both can have an equal break time."
R_7LhMKOVa2mCBqpz,I would split that even 5 minutes because we are both doing this task it is only fair if we are both working on that we have an equal break because we are both putting the same effort in.
R_7fdwFLa7Yh8usV5,"I choose to only have 3 minutes of music for myself as I don't mind doing the boring task. I would still have enough time for one song, and it would give a good break. I also don't really know the person I'm paired with, so I thought I'd be nice and give them more time for music."
R_1d6uH7FHIGPkl9Q,I chose this beacuse i think it's fair for things to be split
R_53TvkxPz0HTRouj,I thought it would only be fair to each take 5. That way we split the time evenly and both leave happy.
R_5oEDHGoZEDJk3Re,I split the minutes between me and my partner.  I did this because it was the most fair and even way to allocate the minutes.
R_39SfDQDYskhgV2x,"Time is less pressing of an issue than money and would be more than happy to split the 10 minutes down the middle with the assignments partner, so they would not have to suffer through the boring exercise any more than I have to."
R_57weqDF5NafiKZE,"because thats a boring activity just like finding letter e, we'd better doing other things."
R_3KfNt6kAI4k2fYi,"I chose to split the 10 minutes and give both of us 5 minutes off. It feels the fairest. Furthermore, given that I don't know my partner well, I don't want to be unnecessarily mean to them."
R_3YnAX4Pu2HJlUFK,I am not better than him so i do not deserve more time and vice versa.  We are both equal and contributed equally so the reward is split equally
R_640P52DANBfhVel,The same reasoning applies here. Why should I get more than somebody that seems to be a nice person? Taking more would just create tension for no reason.
R_3zZu3SQUr1gspwT,I gave each of us five minutes because that gives each of us the chance to listen to a song of our choosing. Most songs run grom 3 1/2 minutes long to 5 minutes long so that gives the both of us at least one song of our choosing to listen to.
R_6G6sZs56fXs1QDr,I split the minutes in half. I did so because it is fair and makes it so we both have the same number of minutes.
R_3sXCbCorNi2tm7v,I picked 5 minutes so it was fair for both of us
R_5vkx2JS9b9XiRF8,"Like I said for the last question, it's only fair if it's even. I don't see why I would be more or less deserving of a break than my partner, we are both performing the same task and are entitled to the same break."
R_5mgXEDcNklWaWDc,I split it because I'm nice
R_5CQ1OEMXYk8KgQG,"I said 5 min for me and 5 min for the person randomly paired. I just think that's the fairest answer because I know that if roles were reversed and that person got to choose, I would want them to pick for both of us to enjoy some music rather than just themselves. I wanted to be fair and not be selfish."
R_6fjAzU15Apvf8IV,I picked 5 minutes for myself and 5 minutes for my partner because I felt it was a fair amount of time.
R_1XhDnRp2A2R7yd8,I split the minutes up where we each got 5 minutes. I did this because I realized how boring the activity was and thought it would be nice to share them.
R_73D2NP8QFBKLkAz,"Much like the money, I wanted the minutes off to be split between my partner and I fairly. Because that would be the correct thing to do."
R_1ab5Mqh3PBpYtyz,I feel like this is different because were doing a task together so I was feeling nice.
R_16i4bgXodwQqZNf,"I would give all 10 minutes to another participant because though I like music, I would get bored just listening to music so I would honestly rather do something that may be deemed slightly unpleasant. Moreover, I know that I wouldn't be hurt or really care if I got no music time so I would rather give it to someone else who may potentially enjoy it more than I would."
R_6kj4bh00Re7IahI,evryone deserves a break!
R_11jxRZf29wIVVIc,its fair and i think spending 10 whole minutes listening to music myself will get me bored
R_3qagv5BLB8hf6qt,"I didn't feel that it was a significant amount of time to be allocated, so I felt that it'd make the most sense to allocate it evenly. I don't think either of us would've gotten enough utility out of the time to outweigh guilt of taking it from the other if it'd been allocated unevenly."
R_1erbKIZnvo3fa4A,"Again, I would split the time off in half. I think it is only fair that we are each given the same amount of time off from doing an annoying task. No one wants to be doing it so why should one person have to endure longer than the other."
R_51pCaa0vXOu3Ky4,We are both completing the same task to the same goal. Her having 5 minutes off as well would benefit me also.
R_5zqDEGx6087CD50,I would give the other participants 5 minutes of time doing the boring task and five minutes of time listening to the music. This is because I can keep the time we are both doing tasks even.
R_7497KfB31wP6e21,"It should be fair, if we are given 10 minutes in total of music, the obvious answer is to distribute them evenly."
R_669Y7T0hG5vXvE3,"I mean the task is only 10 minutes long, honestly I wouldn't even take the break I'd rather just get it over with. However, if in this scenario I would want a break, I'd just split it evenly so we both get a chance to hangout for 5 mins and then finish it."
R_6g7P7a6awguSMOf,I chose to take 6 minutes off myself because I wouldn't mind doing more of the work. I gave my study partner 4 minutes off to another because I just met the other person.
R_7rGiyWbbc0PwEpU,"Because its balanced and I think we both should have an equal oppurtunity to have some time to listen to music. Even though the task is boring, I think it would be fair to both of us to split it evenly."
R_6KeDKfd1g0bOMf8,"Five minutes I wouldn't mind, but ten minutes I would. I think 50/50 is fair and makes the most sense."
R_5Hv6KqUCHdO6Xol,I allocated 5 minutes off to the other participant because in my short conversation with them at the beginning of the study they seemed nice. I also think that if I have the ability to split something evenly with someone that that is something I should do.
R_5flYE7QRBjZd6bc,I did 5 and 5 I wanted it to be fair
R_6OPSvBizU5QR6Qs,"I feel my partner would not feel as bad if I take time to listen to music, chill, etc. It is different than money where you can buy stuff with t."
R_5xUwNa2OIC7Y5Ut,"I've allocated equal time between me and my partner this way it is fair if we both have an equal amount of time off. I don't know my partner that well, so I have no strong negative or positive feelings towards them."
R_3Sfr4X6gk7fJU7X,I chose to give him half the time since that is fair and I would hope he would do the same. Also I don't really think I would want to listen to music that long.
R_6nYLGVGy81waBdY,"distributing the time evenly makes the most sense to me because I think it would make us most productive. If we spent time being upset about who got more time to listen to music, it could take away from doing the task but if we just split it in half there is no room to get upset about the allocation of time."
R_1xYL2SHs1Mvwug9,That way is more fair. I dont want to give this random person I just met more work.
R_30V30Du437EBDIz,I think he would be just fine having one less minute of music
R_52tURThuN8N6FgA,"Same logic as before, it keeps things fair just split it down the middle. Everyone gets the same amount of benefits."
R_6KC7ZJGxFmswTZI,Why would I want to stay in the work area for an extra 10 minutes even if I'm doing nothing? Also why shouldn't the other person get the same break??
R_6oTssSnLC6Suke9,I decided to give my partner one extra minute since I really don't mind doing boring tasks so its on the safe side because it my partner does not like this then they get extra music.
R_3VfpP2CtPLhZxCR,I split the minutes in half between the both of us because I do not know my partner very well.  I do not know if he actually does not like listening to music and would prefer to cross the e's off instead.
R_78SoANKUorQvplL,Because its the only fair way to do it. We each get the same time doing the boring task. And we both get the reward on not doing the boring task for the same amount of time.
R_6EWYl0HqAnAszfi,"I think it was the most fair option. If I found it unpleastent, it's safe to assume they would not want to do the task either. Spliting it evenly allows for us both to take a break."
R_5IrYwSNnXp6SINP,"I said 4 minutes for me and 6 minutes for my partner. Boring tasks like finding all e's in a long series of text would not be enjoyable for me, but if it is really unenjoyable for my partner, why not allow them more relief? If the mundane task doesn't bother them too much, then nothing is lost by giving them some extra music minutes. I don't mind sitting with my thoughts if it means someone else is happy"
R_3NycSHIo2oj317M,i literally dont mind crossing out e's on a paper plus i feel like i wouldnt like the music and is i didnt like the music id go nuts
R_1GEbDt7cruwIO9O,I decided to do an even 50/50 split. That way no one feels upset.
